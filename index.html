        <h1>Angelina Krinos - Engineering Portfolio</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to a collection of my engineering experiments, discoveries, and occasional explosions (controlled ones, of course!). Each project reflects my drive to understand, build, and create solutions for complex systems across energy, aerospace, and beyond. This portfolio is a work in progress and offers a glimpse into my technical journey so far, where I’m blending curiosity, hands-on problem-solving, and a love for discovery into real-world applications. Consists mostly of my school and personal projects, outside of work.

    <h2>Selected Projects</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="projects/stelaris-solar-charging-pcb.html">Stelaris Solar-Powered PCB: Renewable Energy, Simplified</a>  
            – Engineered a custom PCB integrating an ESP32-S3 microcontroller, INA219 sensors, LCD display, and SD card logging, all powered by solar panels. 
            Balancing component selection, power regulation, and data acquisition taught me the nuances of board-level design in renewable energy contexts.</li>

        <li><a href="projects/robosub-power-manipulator.html">Robosub System Electronics & Manipulator Arm</a>  
            – Contributed to the broader electronic and power systems of an underwater robot, ensuring stable power distribution and reliable sensor interfacing. 
            More recently, focused on designing and controlling a custom manipulator arm to let the Robosub interact with its underwater environment effectively.</li>

        <li><a href="projects/sensors-data-fusion.html">Sensors & Data Fusion</a>  
            – Implemented inertial data processing, touch sensing via PRBS-coded signals, and PPG heart rate detection. 
            By applying Kalman filters and advanced signal processing, I turned messy sensor data into meaningful real-world measurements, learning to handle noise, bias, and system integration along the way.</li>

        <li><a href="projects/fusion-reactor.html">Fusion Reactor: Theoretical Concept & Scoping</a>  
            – Investigating the feasibility of a small-scale demonstration fusor. Currently researching vacuum chambers, HV power supplies, and deuterium handling. 
            This is teaching me about plasma physics, safety considerations, and the engineering hurdles throughout the planning and implementation stages.</li>

        <li><a href="projects/ssi-europa-boat.html">SSI Europa Boat: Navigation Design for Exploration of Mars' Moons</a>  
            – Designing a solar-powered, self-righting autonomous boat, inspired by the idea of exploring distant oceans (like Europa’s). 
            Right now, we’re working on stabilizing a resin fishing boat, integrating solar panels, a Raspberry Pi autopilot, and satellite comms. It’s early days—testing small prototypes and learning from each iteration.</li>

        <li><a href="projects/projectile-firing-robot.html">Autonomous Targeting Robot with Firing System</a>  
            – Built a mobile platform that locates targets and fires projectiles autonomously. 
            From basic locomotion and sensor calibration to the control logic of aiming and firing, this project was a crash course in mechatronics and field-testing homemade designs.</li>

        <li><a href="projects/audio-amplifier.html">Precision Audio Amplifier: Boosting Signal Clarity</a>  
            – Developed a high-fidelity audio amplifier circuit, focusing on clean, stable gain stages and noise reduction. 
            This taught me to appreciate how subtle design tweaks in filtering and grounding can lead to noticeably better audio quality.</li>

        <li><a href="projects/optical-cloaking-device.html">Optical Cloaking Device: Making Objects Disappear</a>  
            – Set up a four-lens "Rochester cloak" to make objects appear invisible at certain angles. 
            Experimenting with lens alignment and understanding how tiny misalignments degrade the effect gave me firsthand experience in practical optics experimentation.</li>

        <li><a href="projects/rocket-propellant-system.html">Rocket Propellant Dynamics & Test Stand</a>  
            – Modeled liquid propellant flow and blowdown behavior with MATLAB, then built a simple test stand to measure thrust. 
            Linking simulation to real-world data collection taught me about the challenges of turning theory into reliable hardware outcomes.</li>

        <li><a href="projects/4f-optical-system.html">4F Optical System: Spectroscopy for Quantum Materials</a>  
            – Implemented a 4F optical relay to improve the spectral resolution in a quantum materials spectroscopy setup. 
            Fine-tuning lens spacing and inserting filters at the Fourier plane improved data quality, advancing the precision of quantum material research.</li>

        <li><a href="projects/zeolite-air-purification.html">ISS Zeolite Air Purification: Fresh Air for Space</a>  
            – During my NASA internship, explored 3D-printed zeolite filters to enhance air quality on the ISS. 
            It was about translating materials science theory into something that could feasibly improve astronaut life support in extreme conditions.</li>

        <li><a href="projects/recycled-art-sculpture.html">Recycled Art Sculpture (WIP): Turning Waste into Art</a>  
            – Transforming discarded materials into a piece of art. This project blends sustainability with design, reminding me that engineering principles can apply to aesthetic and environmental creativity too.</li>

        <li><a href="projects/adsorption-bpa-wastewater.html">BPA Removal in Wastewater (WIP)</a>  
            – Early exploration into adsorption-based methods for reducing BPA levels in wastewater streams. 
            This work underscored that even small, incremental improvements in treatment methods can have a real impact on environmental health.</li>
