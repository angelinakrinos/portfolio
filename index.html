        <h1>Angelina Krinos - Engineering Portfolio</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to a collection of my engineering experiments, discoveries, and occasional explosions (controlled ones, of course!). Each project reflects my drive to understand, build, and create solutions for complex systems across energy, aerospace, and beyond. This portfolio is a work in progress and offers a glimpse into my technical journey so far, where I’m blending curiosity, hands-on problem-solving, and a love for discovery into real-world applications.
