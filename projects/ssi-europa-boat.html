        <h1>SSI Europa Boat: Navigation Design for Exploration of Mars' Moons</h1>
        <p>
            This page outlines the early-stage engineering and design work for creating an autonomous, solar-powered 
            boat, inspired by the robust capabilities of long-endurance ocean drones and the forward-looking challenge 
            of navigating remote environments—like those on Mars' moons. While our end goal is ambitious, we’re currently 
            taking practical, incremental steps: assembling hardware, integrating electronics, and testing scaled-down 
            prototypes to guide us forward.

        <section id="introduction">
            <h2>1. Introduction & Vision</h2>
            <p>
                Drawing inspiration from drone ships like Saildrone’s platforms and imagining what navigation 
                might require on distant celestial oceans, this project aims to produce a robust, self-sufficient 
                autonomous vessel. While we talk about “Europa” and Mars’ moons as a guiding theme, we’re firmly 
                grounded on Earth: the immediate goal is a stable, solar-powered boat that can handle real-world 
                oceanic conditions and collect environmental data autonomously.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="concept">
            <h2>2. Initial Concept & Materials</h2>
            <p>
                Our starting point: a 12 ft resin fishing boat sourced from Bass Pro Shops. Over this, we plan to 
                mount an A-frame array of ten 100W solar panels. For propulsion, a 12V outboard motor (36 lbf thrust) 
                and a 50 Ah marine battery will allow slow but continuous operation. The core idea is to test 
                self-sufficiency and endurance on a modest scale—no custom hull design just yet, but a practical 
                starting point.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="stability">
            <h2>3. Focus on Stability & Self-Righting</h2>
            <p>
                Ensuring the boat can survive harsh conditions is crucial. We plan to incorporate a keel weight 
                below the hull, making the boat stable only when upright. If it capsizes, gravity and buoyancy 
                should realign it. The A-frame solar panel structure and potentially adding foam inside the hull 
                will help manage water ingress and prevent pooling, further enhancing stability.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="power">
            <h2>4. Power & Propulsion Setup</h2>
            <p>
                With approximately 1 kW from the solar panels and a 640 W motor draw, we’re aiming for a balanced 
                power budget. The boat might not be fast, but it should be steady and capable of running 
                indefinitely under good sunlight conditions. Steering is handled by a 125 kgf servo directing 
                the outboard motor’s angle.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the electrical engineering (EE) side, I’ve contributed to selecting suitable wiring, ensuring 
                correct voltage regulation, and planning for safe interconnects between the battery, motor 
                controller, and servo drive. Balancing power flows and protecting components are key EE design 
                concerns.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="navigation">
            <h2>5. Navigation, Comms & Sensor Integration</h2>
            <p>
                We’re leveraging ArduPilot’s boat configuration on a Pixhawk flight controller paired with GPS 
                for waypoint navigation. A Raspberry Pi 4 will log data (e.g., temperature, humidity, pressure) 
                and possibly integrate a hydrophone for underwater acoustic data. We’ll use a RockBLOCK satellite 
                modem to relay status updates back home.
            </p>
            <p>
                My contributions on the systems side include integrating these electronics: mounting sensors, 
                setting up the Pi for data acquisition, and configuring basic communication protocols. It’s 
                still early, but we’ve done enough dry runs to confirm the Pi logs data reliably and the satellite 
                link can send short messages.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="testing">
            <h2>6. Prototyping & Preliminary Tests</h2>
            <p>
                We’re not jumping straight into the ocean. Our first test platform is a smaller “bait boat” 
                prototype—much more manageable and less risky for initial experiments. We’ve tested basic 
                maneuvering in calm waters, verifying that the RC mode, motor control, and partial solar 
                charging work as expected.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, we’ll graduate to the 12 ft resin boat, first doing loops in a local lake to test 
                self-righting and waypoint navigation. After that, maybe the SF Bay for longer trials. 
                Each step helps us refine mechanical setups, EE interfaces, and software code before tackling 
                larger challenges.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="future">
            <h2>7. Long-Term Outlook</h2>
            <p>
                Ultimately, we imagine pushing the boat to travel farther offshore, maybe even attempt reaching 
                places like Point Nemo. The lessons learned in incremental testing—power budgeting, communication 
                resilience, navigation reliability—could, in theory, inform how we might design exploratory 
                craft for alien oceans someday.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="conclusion">
            <h2>8. Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Right now, this project is still in a design-focused, scrappy, early-prototyping stage. We’re 
                piecing together off-the-shelf parts, testing our first systems on a small scale, and learning 
                as we go. My role in both EE design and general systems integration ensures that as we progress, 
                we stay grounded in practicality while keeping our sights on a big-picture vision.
