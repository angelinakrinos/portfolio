        <h1>Autonomous Targeting Robot with Projectile-Firing System</h1>
        <p>
            Built from scratch in a mechatronics setting, this robot was designed to navigate autonomously, orient itself 
            reliably, and fire small balls into designated targets. The primary aim was to demonstrate a self-contained 
            system that integrates sensors, actuators, control logic, and mechanical prototyping into a cohesive and 
            repeatable process.

            <h2>1. Overview & Objectives</h2>
            <p>
                The autonomous targeting robot’s purpose was to operate within a timed “game” environment:
                load balls in a “studio” area, move out to the playing field, and fire balls into press buckets—either our 
                “good” bucket or the opponent’s “bad” bucket. A key objective was quick and precise orientation in the 
                loading zone to ensure consistent shooting angles and repeatable scoring. We focused heavily on robust 
                orientation methods and a reliable firing mechanism.
            </p>
            <p>
                The final system could:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Navigate out of a confined space</li>
                <li>Orient itself against walls using ultrasonic sensors and physical alignment</li>
                <li>Fire small balls using a custom-built flywheel-based shooter</li>
                <li>Return to the loading zone, reorient, and repeat the cycle</li>
                <li>Toggle targets via a button input to switch between aiming at “good” or “bad” press buckets</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="mechanical-design">
            <h2>2. Mechanical Design & Shooter Mechanism</h2>
            <p>
                The mechanical design aimed to keep the drivetrain simple and robust. The robot used two DC drive 
                motors for translational and rotational movement. We prioritized durability and quick iteration during 
                testing phases. The primary mechanical challenge was the projectile-firing subsystem.
            </p>
            <h3>Shooter Development</h3>
            <p>
                Early concepts for the ball launcher included dual flywheels, single flywheels, and even catapults. 
                We converged on a single flywheel design for predictability and easier tuning. Initially constructed 
                with cardboard and off-the-shelf wheels, we later moved to laser-cut duron prototypes and a custom 
                3D-printed flywheel. The final setup balanced simplicity, accuracy, and repeatability:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Initial Cardboard & Tape Prototype:</strong> Verified feasibility with crude construction.</li>
                <li><strong>Second Iteration (Dual Flywheel):</strong> More rigid duron frame, improved accuracy but suffered from 
                    inconsistent spin rates and ball trajectory variations.</li>
                <li><strong>Final Single Flywheel Setup:</strong> Stiffer frame, custom flywheel, and a guided chute. This 
                    yielded better accuracy and a repeatable trajectory, good enough for our bouncing strategy into target buckets.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Future refinements might involve adding speed control feedback for the flywheel motor or more precise 
                wheel-to-shaft alignment to further reduce variability.

        <section id="electronics-power">
            <h2>3. Electronics & Power Management</h2>
            <p>
                The robot’s electronic system integrated multiple components—motors, servos, ultrasonic sensors, 
                a button input, and the Arduino microcontroller—with limited pin availability and strict power constraints.
            </p>
            <h3>Power Supply</h3>
            <p>
                Two supplied batteries were stepped down to a stable 7.2 V via separate LM2596 buck converters:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>One buck converter dedicated to the Arduino to avoid “brown outs”</li>
                <li>Another converter for the drive and shooter motors</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Even though motors were rated for higher voltages, running at 7.2 V allowed lower speeds that enhanced 
                orientation accuracy and minimized instability.
            </p>

            <h3>Arduino Connections & Pin Constraints</h3>
            <p>
                With multiple motors and sensors, pin availability became an issue. To reduce pin usage, a 74HC14 inverter 
                was employed so each motor’s direction control could be managed with a single Arduino pin. Nearly all PWM-capable 
                pins were used: each DC motor driver got a PWM line, and two servo motors (one for waving, one for ball feeding) 
                also demanded PWM channels.
            </p>
            <p>
                A push button on an analog pin (A1) toggled between targeting modes. Ultrasonic sensors, each needing a trigger 
                and echo pin, completed the sensor array.
            </p>

        <section id="software-strategy">
            <h2>4. Software Strategy & State Machine</h2>
            <h3>State Machine Overview</h3>
            <p>
                The robot’s behavior was governed by a state machine to streamline transitions between loading, orienting, 
                shooting, and returning states. Key states included:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>WAVE:</strong> Wave arm servo as a start signal.</li>
                <li><strong>FORWARD, BACKWARD, TURNING:</strong> Basic locomotion states to position the robot.</li>
                <li><strong>ORIENT:</strong> Use sensors and wall alignment to achieve precise orientation.</li>
                <li><strong>SHOOTING:</strong> Fire balls by activating the shooter servo and flywheel.</li>
                <li><strong>RELOAD:</strong> Cycle the loading mechanism for another round of shots.</li>
                <li><strong>END:</strong> Conclude operations once time is up or objectives met.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                By defining states clearly and assigning conditions for transitions, we maintained structured, traceable, 
                and debuggable code. A single timer (using the Metro library) managed round timing.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="orientation">
            <h2>5. Orientation & Positioning</h2>
            <p>
                Achieving quick and precise orientation was critical. Our approach combined ultrasonic sensors with 
                a physical alignment technique using a wall:
            </p>
            <h3>Ultrasonic-Based Orientation</h3>
            <p>
                Initially, the robot spun in place, sampling two perpendicular ultrasonic sensors. The key was to find 
                the robot’s orientation where both sensors read minimum distances simultaneously. To improve sensor reliability:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Flatten sensor mounting for consistent reflections</li>
                <li>Averaged multiple readings to smooth noise</li>
                <li>Discarded initial readings and introduced delays for stable data</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Once both sensors indicated a minimal distance, the robot was approximately oriented.
            </p>
            <h3>Wall-Alignment for Fine-Tuning</h3>
            <p>
                After ultrasonic-based alignment, the robot backed into a wall. By gently reversing into it and then 
                turning each wheel independently, we achieved a near-perfect orientation reset. This was fast, reliable, 
                and essential for repeating cycles with minimal drift over time.

            <h2>6. Bill of Materials & Cost Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                The project stayed within a reasonable budget. Many components came from existing lab kits or storerooms, 
                minimizing expenses. Major purchased components included DC motors, a 74HC14 inverter, L298N motor drivers, 
                a few mechanical parts like wheels and motor mounts, and some ultrasonic sensors. An example partial BOM:

                Total expenses stayed well under a $200 budget cap, primarily because many essential parts (Arduino,
