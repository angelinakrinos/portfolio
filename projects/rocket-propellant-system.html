    <h2>I. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Developing and testing rocket propulsion systems isn’t just about firing an engine; it’s about understanding 
        and predicting how propellants behave over time, and building the hardware that safely measures thrust. 
        Throughout this project, I contributed on two fronts: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>**Simulation Work:** Assisting with a MATLAB-based propellant flow simulation tool, aiming to model 
            blowdown behavior and fluid-structure interactions in a flexible, modular way.</li>
        <li>**Test Stand Fabrication:** Helping design and build a new hot fire test stand that would provide stable, 
            accurate thrust measurements and integrate seamlessly with our propulsion ground support equipment.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        These efforts align with industry standards: before a launch, major aerospace companies rely on validated 
        simulations and robust test stands to ensure engines perform as expected. At SSI, we followed a similar 
        approach—just on a more modest scale.
    </p>

<section id="simulation">
    <h2>II. MATLAB-Based Propellant Simulation</h2>
    <p>
        As part of the team’s push for more accurate predictions, I helped refine a MATLAB simulation tool (codenamed 
        “FrogFlow”) that models self-pressurizing propellant systems and blowdown dynamics. Previously, the group used 
        a tool called “PropSim,” but it had limitations: it was hard-coded, not very extensible, and didn’t handle more 
        complex scenarios well.
    </p>
    <p>
        The new simulation framework:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Class-Based Architecture:</strong> Components (like tanks, gas plenums, orifices) are nodes and conduits, making it easy to swap parts in and out.</li>
        <li><strong>Fluids & Equations:</strong> We considered ideal gas and Van der Waals gas models, along with incompressible liquids, to capture realistic thermodynamic states.</li>
        <li><strong>Numerical Integration:</strong> Using MATLAB’s ODE solvers (like <code>ode15s</code>) to handle stiff equations and track changing tank pressures and temperatures over time.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        My role involved reviewing code modules, testing small changes, and comparing outputs against known analytical benchmarks. 
        Helping with debugging and parameter setup gave me a deeper understanding of what factors affect blowdown rates and how sensitive the simulation is to initial conditions.
    </p>

<section id="test-stand">
    <h2>III. Hot Fire Test Stand Analysis & Fabrication</h2>
    <p>
        On the hardware side, I assisted in updating our hot fire test stand. The previous stand had issues: too much vibration, 
        not easily portable, and awkward geometry that made integrating load cells and routing cables a hassle. With an upcoming 
        hot fire test, we needed a sturdier, more user-friendly solution.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Design Goals:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Accurate thrust measurement (alignment of load cells and engine)</li>
        <li>Portability (reduced mass, quick-release pins for easy transport)</li>
        <li>Minimized vibration (symmetrical load paths, welded rectangular tubing)</li>
        <li>Structural integrity (gussets, careful welding procedures)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        My contributions included breaking down the CAD model, understanding how each component fit together, and assisting with 
        fabrication tasks like preparing steel tubes, positioning parts for welding, and cleaning the final welds. During test day, 
        I helped set up the stand, ensure load cells were correctly placed, and verify that everything was aligned before the engine fired.
    </p>

<section id="methods">
    <h2>IV. Methodology: Fabrication & Simulation Integration</h2>
    <p>
        On the hardware side, I learned MIG welding basics and good shop practices—cleaning metal surfaces, using the right 
        welding parameters, and following a logical sequence: tack first, check alignment, then do final welds. On the simulation 
        side, it was about careful parameter selection, ensuring that fluid properties and initial conditions were realistic, and 
        running small test cases to confirm expected behavior.
    </p>

<section id="results">
    <h2>V. Results</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Simulation:</strong> The improved MATLAB tool gave smoother, more realistic blowdown profiles. We could simulate 
        how tank pressure changed over time as propellant was consumed, validating the approach by comparing against known 
        approximate solutions. While still a work in progress, it’s more flexible and easier to expand than before.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Test Stand:</strong> The new stand performed well during the hot fire test. It withstood thrust loads without 
        excessive vibration, and the load cells provided stable readings. The design changes—like adding toggle clamps for 
        preload—improved measurement accuracy, and the stand’s reduced weight made transport and setup much easier.
    </p>

<section id="key-learnings">
    <h2>VI. Key Learnings & Takeaways</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Multidisciplinary Insight:</strong> Working on both simulation and hardware reinforced how theory informs design, 
            and how test results validate simulation assumptions.</li>
        <li><strong>Hands-On Skills:</strong> Welding, cutting, and fixturing metal gave me practical mechanical skills and an appreciation for craftsmanship.</li>
        <li><strong>Better Data & Predictions:</strong> More accurate simulation means we can predict performance and identify issues before firing the engine. 
            Better test stand design means we can trust the measurements we collect.</li>
        <li><strong>Team Collaboration:</strong> Learned from experienced team members, combined their knowledge with my own, and contributed meaningfully to a successful outcome.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="future-work">
    <h2>VII. Future Work</h2>
    <p>
        On the simulation side, we want to implement more complex fluid models and validate them against experimental data. Eventually, 
        we could integrate combustion models or interface with C++ backends for speed.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the test stand, painting and adding a rotational pivot might be next steps. We could also incorporate more instrumentation 
        (temperature, vibration sensors) to gain richer insights during test campaigns.
    </p>

<section id="conclusion">
    <h2>VIII. Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        By working on both propellant simulation software and the hot fire test stand, I got to see the full cycle: from modeling fluid 
        dynamics in MATLAB to physically welding steel and setting up a real engine test. It’s one thing to run a simulation, and another 
        to see metal, bolts, and flame in real life. This integrated approach taught me the value of balancing theoretical predictions 
        with practical engineering reality.
