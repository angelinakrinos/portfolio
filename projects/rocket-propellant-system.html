        <h1>Propellant Dynamics & Hot Fire Test Stand</h1>
        <p>
            This document outlines my work on a MATLAB-based propellant simulation tool and the development of a 
            robust hot fire test stand for the Stanford Student Space Initiative’s propulsion activities. From 
            modeling fluid blowdown dynamics to welding steel tubing, this effort marries theoretical analysis 
            with hands-on engineering.

            <h2>1. Introduction & Goals</h2>
            <p>
                Before testing a rocket engine, it’s essential to predict how the propellants will behave (pressure, 
                flow rates, and stability) and to have a test stand capable of accurately measuring thrust. My 
                objectives included refining an existing propellant simulation framework to provide better modeling 
                of blowdown scenarios and assisting in building a test stand that captures stable thrust readings 
                during hot fire events.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="simulation">
            <h2>2. MATLAB Simulation Improvements</h2>
            <p>
                The simulation tool, originally called PropSim, needed more flexibility and realism. I contributed 
                to enhancing a new class-based MATLAB framework that models nodes (tanks, gas plenums) and conduits 
                (orifices, valves) to simulate blowdown of self-pressurizing propellants. By refining parameters, 
                testing code modules, and comparing results against benchmarks, we achieved smoother, more 
                trustworthy predictions of how tank pressure and fluid states evolve over time.
            </p>
            <p>
                These improvements pave the way for predicting engine feed conditions more accurately, ultimately 
                informing design tweaks before physical testing.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="test-stand">
            <h2>3. Hot Fire Test Stand Design & Fabrication</h2>
            <p>
                The previous stand had issues: vibration, awkward dimensions, and portability challenges. We redesigned 
                it to feature welded rectangular tubing, gussets for rigidity, and toggle clamps for preload. The goal: 
                a stand that safely holds the engine, directs thrust into load cells for accurate measurement, and 
                remains portable enough for on-campus test campaigns.
            </p>
            <p>
                I helped design the CAD model,led the welding process (MIG welding), and participated in 
                final assembly. On test day, the stand performed well, offering stable readings and smoother integration 
                with instrumentation.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="methods">
            <h2>4. Methodology & Integration</h2>
            <p>
                On the simulation side, I reviewed code structure, tested small changes, and ensured that each component’s 
                equations made sense physically. On the fabrication side, I learned MIG welding basics, carefully followed 
                a tack-then-weld approach, and maintained strict safety protocols.
            </p>
            <p>
                Integrating both efforts means our simulations can inform test parameters (like initial tank pressure), 
                and the test stand’s data can validate or refine the simulation model. It’s a virtuous cycle of theory 
                guiding practice and practice feeding back into theory.
            </p>

        <section id="results">
            <h2>5. Results & Performance</h2>
            <p>
                The updated simulation tool produced more stable blowdown curves, revealing subtle effects of orifice 
                sizing and fluid properties. The new test stand withstood a hot fire test, delivering cleaner thrust data 
                with reduced vibration artifacts.
            </p>
            <p>
                These results mean we’re better positioned to make data-driven improvements. Instead of guesswork, we 
                have reliable numbers—both from predictive modeling and from actual engine firings.

            <h2>7. Future Work</h2>
            <p>
                Next steps include integrating more complex fluid models into the simulation and possibly adding 
                combustion modeling. For the test stand, we might incorporate more sensors (temperature, vibration 
                monitors) and consider painting or adding a rotational pivot.

        <section id="conclusion">
            <h2>8. Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                By contributing to both the MATLAB simulation improvements and the hot fire test stand fabrication, 
                I gained a fuller picture of how theory meets real-world constraints. This project reinforced the 
                importance of holistic engineering approaches—where modeling, building, and testing inform each other, 
                ultimately leading to more reliable rocket propulsion development.
