        <h1>4F Optical System: Spectroscopy for Quantum Materials</h1>
        <p>
            In advanced quantum materials research, precise optical characterization is key. I assisted in setting up 
            a 4F optical system to enhance photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy measurements, facilitating clearer 
            spectral lines and improved data quality for studying color centers in diamond, hBN, and related quantum 
            systems.

            <h2>1. Introduction & Goals</h2>
            <p>
                Characterizing quantum defects in solid-state materials often hinges on extracting high-quality optical 
                signals. Our aim: implement a 4F optical relay to improve filtering and imaging of the sample’s PL signal, 
                enabling more robust spectral measurements and reducing unwanted background noise.
            </p>
            <p>
                By carefully tailoring the optical path, we can isolate subtle emission lines, identify zero-phonon 
                lines (ZPLs), and correlate spectral shifts with changes in spin states or external stimuli.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="principles">
            <h2>2. 4F Optical Principles & Configuration</h2>
            <p>
                A 4F system uses two lenses in series, each placed one focal length away from the intermediate Fourier plane. 
                This configuration allows spatial filtering by placing apertures or frequency-selective elements in the 
                Fourier plane, effectively modifying the beam’s mode structure.
            </p>
            <p>
                Implementing beam splitters, narrow bandpass filters, or polarization elements in the Fourier plane 
                refines the output beam heading into the spectrometer, ensuring cleaner line shapes and better 
                signal-to-noise ratios.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="setup">
            <h2>3. System Setup & Alignment</h2>
            <p>
                I helped mount the lenses and adjustable filter holders on an optical rail. The key steps:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Ensuring each lens was positioned precisely at its focal distance 
                    from the Fourier plane.</li>
                <li><strong>Filter Insertion:</strong> Placing bandpass filters or spatial apertures at the Fourier plane 
                    to reject unwanted modes.</li>
                <li><strong>Integration with Spectrometer:</strong> The filtered beam was directed into a spectrometer’s 
                    entrance slit, capturing improved PL spectra.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Fine adjustments in lens tilt and filter placement helped minimize aberrations and ensure stable, repeatable measurements.
            </p>

        <section id="results">
            <h2>4. Results & Impact on Research</h2>
            <p>
                The improved optical setup led to sharper spectral peaks, enabling the detection of subtle ZPLs and 
                emission lines previously drowned out by background light. With cleaner data, we could more confidently 
                attribute spectral features to specific defects or spin states, advancing the group’s understanding of 
                quantum materials.
            </p>
            <p>
                This system makes future experiments more efficient, reducing the time spent troubleshooting optical noise 
                and enhancing the reproducibility of results.

        <section id="learnings">
            <h2>5. Key Learnings & Takeaways</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Optical Alignment Skills:</strong> Even a millimeter off in lens spacing can degrade results, 
                    underlining the importance of careful setup.</li>
                <li><strong>System Flexibility:</strong> The 4F system’s modular nature allows quick swapping of filters or apertures, 
                    making it versatile for different sample types.</li>
                <li><strong>Collaborative Environment:</strong> Working alongside physicists and engineers taught me how optical 
                    design directly enhances scientific outcomes.</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="future">
            <h2>6. Next Steps & Outlook</h2>
            <p>
                Potential enhancements include adding automated filter wheels or coupling the 4F system with scanning 
                stages to map spatial emission variations. Exploring more advanced optical elements (e.g., spatial light 
                modulators) could further refine mode control.
            </p>

        <section id="conclusion">
            <h2>7. Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Building and refining the 4F optical setup was a hands-on lesson in how precision optics elevate experimental 
                quality. With improved PL spectroscopy, we can push deeper into the quantum material landscape, identifying 
                and characterizing novel defects and spin qubits, and ultimately driving forward the frontiers of quantum engineering.
