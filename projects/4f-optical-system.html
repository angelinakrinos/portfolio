    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
        In cutting-edge quantum materials research—particularly with solid-state spin qubits and color centers—extracting 
        detailed optical and spin information often comes down to careful control of the photons entering and leaving 
        your sample. I assisted in setting up a 4F optical system to perform photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, a crucial 
        step towards more precise characterization of color centers in diamond and hBN, as well as other promising quantum materials.
    </p>
    <p>
        This kind of 4F configuration uses two lenses to create a one-to-one image relay, allowing selective filtering and 
        spatial manipulation of the beam within the Fourier plane. By integrating beam splitters, bandpass filters, and 
        confocal imaging elements, we tuned our system for better signal-to-noise ratios, improved spectral resolution, 
        and cleaner detection of the emission lines from the materials under study.

    <h2>4F Optical Setup Details</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Fourier Plane Filtering:</strong> By placing spatial filters or frequency-selective elements in the 
            Fourier plane between the two lenses, we can isolate certain modes or wavelengths, enhancing measurement clarity.</li>
        <li><strong>Lenses & Alignment:</strong> We used well-characterized lenses with matching focal lengths, precisely 
            aligned on an optical rail. Adjusting lens separations and angles ensured that the image formed at the final 
            focal plane had minimal aberrations.</li>
        <li><strong>Integration with Spectrometer:</strong> The output beam from the 4F line was directed into a spectrometer, 
            enabling high-resolution PL measurements. This setup facilitated accurate mapping of zero-phonon lines (ZPLs) and 
            other spectral features critical for identifying and characterizing spin qubit centers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Impact on Quantum Materials Research</h2>
    <p>
        The improved 4F optical system translated directly into more trustworthy data. By trimming unwanted background 
        light and sharpening spectral peaks, we could identify subtle shifts in emission lines, detect changes in 
        intensity under different excitation conditions, and correlate those variations to spin properties in the 
        material’s defect centers.
    </p>
    <p>
        These enhancements make the system more robust for ongoing experiments: from characterizing new samples with 
        unknown defects to refining protocols for optical readout of spin states. Ultimately, this 4F optical 
        configuration helps bridge the gap between theoretical quantum material predictions and experimental confirmation, 
        pushing our understanding and control of quantum defects forward.

    <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Precision & Stability:</strong> Good optical alignment isn’t just about getting rid of stray reflections—it’s crucial for stable, reproducible spectra.</li>
        <li><strong>System Iteration:</strong> Fine-tuning lens positions, adding or removing filters, and adjusting beam split ratios taught me how flexible a 4F system can be.</li>
        <li><strong>Collaborative Insights:</strong> Working alongside physicists and engineers in the lab underscored how optical design directly influences the scientific yield of quantum materials research.</li>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Setting up a 4F optical system for PL spectroscopy wasn’t just a technical exercise—it was a key step toward 
        higher-fidelity data and better-informed insights into the properties of quantum defects. By combining standard 
        optical elements with careful engineering, the system advances our experimental capabilities, enabling more 
        nuanced investigations of quantum materials and the spin qubits they host.
