    <h2>Introduction & Motivation</h2>
    <p>
        Optical cloaking—making objects appear “invisible” by guiding light around them—seems straight out of science fiction. 
        Yet, using a clever configuration of just four lenses (the “Rochester Cloak”), we can cause a small object to partially 
        vanish from a viewer’s perspective within a limited range of angles. Our goal was to construct such a system, applying 
        ray optics theory, careful mechanical alignment, and quantitative reasoning to understand where and why the object disappears.
    </p>
    <p>
        This project is more than a demonstration of a visual trick: it tests our ability to link theoretical imaging conditions 
        with practical constraints. By designing a system of lenses to simulate free-space propagation and careful magnification 
        management, we learn about Fourier optics, ABCD matrix analysis, and the subtle interplay of real-world imperfections.
    </p>

<section id="objectives">
    <h2>Key Learning Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Understand the underlying ray optics theory enabling cloaking: lens pairs arranged to emulate free-space propagation.</li>
        <li>Use quantitative metrics—focal lengths, magnifications, ABCD matrices—to guide the design and predict cloaking regions.</li>
        <li>Develop precision alignment skills, recognizing how small mechanical tolerances affect the optical image.</li>
        <li>Explore how object size, background patterning, and illumination influence the perception of invisibility.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="theory">
    <h2>Theoretical Background & Quantitative Framework</h2>
    <p>
        The Rochester cloak can be viewed as two cascaded Keplerian telescope configurations. Each telescope consists of 
        two lenses separated by the sum of their focal lengths. Consider two lens pairs (L1–L2 and L3–L4):
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>First pair: focal lengths f<sub>1</sub> and f<sub>2</sub>, arranged so that d<sub>1</sub> = f<sub>1</sub> + f<sub>2</sub> and similarly d<sub>3</sub> = f<sub>1</sub> + f<sub>2</sub> for symmetry.</li>
        <li>Second pair: ideally chosen to invert the minification or magnification imposed by the first pair, such that the total magnification M = M<sub>1</sub>×M<sub>2</sub> = 1.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Let’s be more explicit. For a single thin lens of focal length f, the ABCD matrix (paraxial ray optics formalism) is:
    </p>
    <pre>
A = 1, B = 0
C = -1/f, D = 1
    </pre>

    <p>
        For free space of length d:
    </p>
    <pre>
A = 1, B = d
C = 0, D = 1
    </pre>

    <p>
        The cloak consists of a sequence: Lens (f<sub>1</sub>) – space (f<sub>1</sub>+f<sub>2</sub>) – Lens (f<sub>2</sub>) – space (D<sub>2</sub>) – Lens (f<sub>2</sub>) – space (f<sub>1</sub>+f<sub>2</sub>) – Lens (f<sub>1</sub>).
        With ideal choices (f<sub>1</sub>=200 mm, f<sub>2</sub>=75 mm, distances ~275 mm and ~330 mm), the combined ABCD matrix 
        approximates a scenario where input rays emerge essentially as if the space was empty, except for finite apertures and real lens imperfections.
    </p>

    <p>
        Another key parameter is magnification. If the first telescope segment minifies the image by M<sub>1</sub>=f<sub>2</sub>/f<sub>1</sub><1, 
        and the second one magnifies it by M<sub>2</sub>=f<sub>1</sub>/f<sub>2</sub>>1, their product M<sub>1</sub>·M<sub>2</sub>=1. This ensures 
        the final image returns to the original size, theoretically “mapping” the background behind the object onto the observer’s retina 
        as if the object weren’t there.
    </p>
</section>

<section id="setup">
    <h2>Experimental Setup & Fine-Tuning</h2>
    <p>
        We constructed the system on an optical rail. Target distances approximated:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>f<sub>1</sub> = 200 mm, f<sub>2</sub> = 75 mm</li>
        <li>d<sub>1</sub>=d<sub>3</sub>=f<sub>1</sub>+f<sub>2</sub>=275 mm (theoretically), actual ~270–275 mm</li>
        <li>d<sub>2</sub> ~330 mm (theoretically), actual ~325 mm</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Tiny misalignments quickly degrade the cloak. We used micrometer adjustments in height and tilt. A uniform background behind 
        L4 minimized distracting patterns. We illuminated the setup with diffuse ambient light to reduce specular reflections.
    </p>
</section>

<section id="observations">
    <h2>Observations & Experimental Data</h2>
    <p>
        After careful tuning, small objects placed ~8–10 cm behind the second lens pair and aligned along the optical axis nearly disappeared. 
        At viewing angles close to the axis, their silhouette vanished against the uniform background.
    </p>
    <p>
        For a thin 5 mm rod, the rod’s apparent contrast dropped dramatically—our eyes perceived a gap in the rod’s location, essentially 
        “seeing through” it. For larger objects (e.g., 30 mm diameter), full invisibility was not achieved; however, partial transparency 
        occurred, consistent with reduced aperture and the angle-limited cloak region.
    </p>
    <p>
        By altering the background and measuring the object’s apparent contrast, we confirmed that the cloaking effectiveness depends 
        on object size (smaller is better), precise lens spacing (closer to the calculated distances improves cloaking), and angle.
    </p>
</section>

<section id="discussion">
    <h2>Discussion & Future Directions</h2>
    <p>
        The ABCD matrix formalism suggests that if our combined system approached the identity matrix, rays would pass as if no object 
        existed. Realistically, lens apertures, finite precision in focal lengths, and mechanical tolerances ensure we get a matrix close 
        but not equal to identity. The result: a partial cloak within a limited angular acceptance and object size range.
    </p>
    <p>
        Future improvements could include using larger-diameter lenses to increase the cloaking zone, implementing a stricter alignment 
        protocol to minimize off-axis aberrations, or even introducing adaptive optical elements. Metamaterial-based or gradient-index 
        elements might broaden the angular range or cloak more complex shapes. Additionally, a more rigorous quantitative mapping 
        (e.g., measuring intensity profiles with and without the object at various angles) would offer a deeper analytical understanding.
    </p>

<section id="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusions & Reflections</h2>
    <p>
        We successfully built and demonstrated a functional optical cloak that matches theoretical predictions for a simple four-lens 
        setup. The angle-dependent, donut-shaped cloaking region appeared as expected, and smaller objects consistently vanished for 
        a narrow viewing angle range.
    </p>
    <p>
        This project advanced our understanding of how idealized optical designs translate into real devices. It underscored the importance 
        of quantitative tools—like ABCD matrices and precise focal length relationships—to guide design and interpret deviations. In short, 
        it was a rich exercise in applying theoretical optics to produce a tangible optical phenomenon.
