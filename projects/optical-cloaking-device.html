<section id="introduction">
    <h2>Introduction & Motivation</h2>
    <p>
        When we first heard about optical cloaking—making objects “disappear” by manipulating how light passes around them—it 
        sounded more like science fiction than a feasible lab project. But the Rochester Cloak concept, pioneered by University 
        of Rochester researchers, provided a surprisingly straightforward path using off-the-shelf lenses and careful geometric 
        alignment. Our goal: replicate a broadband optical cloaking setup on a lab bench and learn about Fourier optics, spatial 
        filtering, and the painstaking alignment required to fool the human eye.
    </p>
    <p>
        While the system won’t hide a tank from an enemy line-of-sight, it can produce a striking effect: an object placed behind 
        our lens arrangement becomes partially invisible to a viewer slightly off-axis. Beyond the obvious “cool” factor, this 
        project reinforces fundamental optical engineering skills—understanding ray optics, designing multi-lens imaging systems, 
        and contending with real-world imperfections.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Learning Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Apply paraxial ray optics to design a multi-lens cloaking system.</li>
        <li>Experience hands-on challenges in alignment, focusing, and spatial filtering.</li>
        <li>Examine how object size, position, and background influence perceived invisibility.</li>
        <li>Bridge theory and experiment, evaluating why a donut-shaped cloaking region arises.</li>
        <li>Discuss engineering trade-offs and scalability (e.g., lens diameter, focal lengths, metamaterials) for more robust cloaking effects.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="theory">
    <h2>Theoretical Background</h2>
    <p>
        The cloaking setup can be analyzed as two cascaded Keplerian beam expanders. Each pair of lenses attempts to reproduce 
        free-space propagation over a certain path, effectively “mapping” the region behind the second lens onto the space in 
        front without showing the object in between.
    </p>
    <p>
        The system parameters:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Focal lengths chosen:</strong> f<sub>1</sub> = 200 mm, f<sub>2</sub> = 75 mm.</li>
        <li><strong>Distance arrangement:</strong> d<sub>1</sub> = d<sub>3</sub> = f<sub>1</sub> + f<sub>2</sub> = 275 mm.</li>
        <li><strong>Magnifications:</strong> M<sub>1</sub> &lt; 1 and M<sub>2</sub> > 1, arranged so M<sub>1</sub>·M<sub>2</sub> = 1. This ensures the total system’s effective magnification returns 
            the image size to that of the original object, but with certain rays bypassing the region where the object would appear.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In theory, if perfectly aligned and if the lenses were infinitely large, the object placed at the cloaking plane would 
        vanish for a range of viewing angles. In practice, finite lens diameters, imperfect focal length matches, and mechanical 
        tolerances lead to partial invisibility and edge ghosting.
    </p>
</section>

<section id="setup">
    <h2>Experimental Setup & Fine-Tuning</h2>
    <p>
        The hardware consisted of four lenses arranged along an optical rail with adjustable lens mounts. We started by placing 
        the lenses according to the theoretical distances:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>D<sub>1</sub> ≈ 275 mm, D<sub>2</sub> ≈ 325 mm, D<sub>3</sub> ≈ 270 mm (slightly off from theory but close enough).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Achieving the cloaking effect required meticulous height and tilt adjustments. Each lens was set on posts with fine-thread 
        screws to shift them in the vertical (y) direction by fractions of a millimeter. Any misalignment introduced distortions, 
        reduced the cloaking zone, or caused the object to partially show up as faint edges.
    </p>
    <p>
        The background behind the final lens stack mattered. A uniform background helped the cloaking effect. High-contrast backgrounds 
        revealed subtle shadows or refractive differences. Illumination also played a role—soft, even lighting minimized glare and 
        helped the object fade from view.
    </p>
</section>

<section id="observations">
    <h2>Observations & Challenges</h2>
    <p>
        After fine-tuning, we found a donut-shaped cloaking region: an annulus where small objects disappeared best. Objects placed 
        too far off-axis or too large in diameter would not fully cloak. Thin vertical rods (≈5 mm diameter) vanished more convincingly 
        than broader objects like a 30 mm fidget ball.
    </p>
    <p>
        The cloaking effect varied strongly with the viewer’s angle. Within a narrow angular window (a few degrees off-axis), the object 
        behind our lens assembly seemed to vanish. Shifting slightly left or right made portions of the object reappear at the edges. 
        This sensitivity matched theoretical predictions that perfect cloaking is highly angle-dependent unless more sophisticated 
        optics or metamaterials are employed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another subtlety: the system’s finite lens apertures introduced vignetting and ghostly outlines of the object’s edges, especially 
        for larger or off-center objects. The difference between theory and experiment taught us that real optical systems are limited 
        by component tolerances, alignment difficulty, and the complexity of ensuring a pristine wavefront reproduction.
    </p>
</section>

<section id="measurements">
    <h2>Measurements & Alignment Results</h2>
    <p>
        Our measured lens separations ended up slightly off from the ideal: D<sub>2</sub> was about 325 mm rather than the predicted 330 mm. 
        These minor deviations altered the exact cloaking zone. Still, the observed donut-shaped region and partial invisibility confirmed 
        we were operating close to the intended design.
    </p>
    <p>
        By systematically testing objects of different diameters and placing them at various depths near the second lens plane, we 
        identified the most robust cloaking occurred for small (5–10 mm) objects placed roughly 8–10 cm behind the second lens. Larger 
        objects never fully vanished, but their central portions at least became dimmer, indicating partial cloaking.
    </p>
</section>

<section id="discussion">
    <h2>Discussion & Potential Improvements</h2>
    <p>
        Engineering a better cloak could involve larger-diameter lenses to reduce edge effects, more precisely matched focal lengths, 
        or even active wavefront shaping using adaptive optics. Metamaterial-based designs, though beyond our lab scope, could enable 
        broader angular cloaking or less stringent alignment. Additionally, developing a quantitative method to map out the cloaking 
        region—perhaps by scanning a small test probe and recording intensity—would give more rigorous data.
    </p>
    <p>
        Scaling the system: A bigger setup might cloak larger objects but require correspondingly larger lenses and more careful 
        alignment. Miniaturization is also possible; shorter focal lengths and tighter spacing could make a compact cloak, but at 
        the cost of more sensitivity to manufacturing tolerances.
    </p>
</section>

<section id="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusions & Reflection</h2>
    <p>
        We successfully created a rudimentary optical cloak. The effect was fragile and limited, but unmistakable for small objects 
        and precise viewing angles. The donut-shaped cloaking region and the angle dependence matched theoretical expectations. 
        Gaining these insights required interdisciplinary thinking—combining geometric optics design, meticulous mechanical alignment, 
        and hands-on troubleshooting.
    </p>
    <p>
        This project taught us more than just how to make something “disappear.” We learned what it means to push optical systems to 
        their limits, how sensitive they are to tiny deviations, and how implementing even a “simple” concept in real optics demands 
        patience and creativity. It was a fitting culmination of our optics coursework, blending theory, practice, and a hint of magic.
