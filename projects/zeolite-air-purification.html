        <h1>ISS Zeolite Air Purification: Fresh Air for Space</h1>
        <p>
            As a high school intern at NASA, I had the chance to get my hands dirty in materials science research 
            aimed at improving air quality on the International Space Station (ISS). Using 3D-printed zeolite 
            materials, we experimented with ways to keep astronauts breathing cleaner air in orbit, where every 
            bit of fresh air counts.

            <h2>1. Introduction & Context</h2>
            <p>
                The ISS relies on carefully managed life support systems to keep the atmosphere safe and breathable. 
                Traditional filters, while effective, can be bulky and challenging to replace. Our project explored 
                using zeolites—porous, crystal-like structures known for their adsorption capabilities—and tried to 
                shape them into new forms using 3D printing. The idea: create lighter, more efficient filters that 
                capture harmful compounds and maybe even regenerate them onboard.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="background">
            <h2>2. Why Zeolites?</h2>
            <p>
                Zeolites are like tiny, molecular-level sieves that can selectively trap certain molecules. On Earth, 
                they’re used for all sorts of filtration tasks. In space, if we can print them into custom shapes that 
                fit neatly into existing hardware, we might save weight and boost performance. This could mean 
                cleaner, safer air for astronauts without adding a ton of logistical complexity.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="approach">
            <h2>3. Our Approach: 3D Printing & Testing</h2>
            <p>
                Under my mentor’s guidance, I helped mix zeolite powders with polymer binders to form a paste we could 
                feed into a 3D printer. We tweaked parameters like nozzle size and printing speed to get stable shapes 
                that wouldn’t collapse. After printing, we’d heat-treat (sinter) the parts to remove the binder and 
                create a stable, porous structure.
            </p>
            <p>
                My role included checking the consistency of our pastes, noting which blends printed best, and documenting 
                the results. It felt like cooking—except the recipe was a futuristic air filter.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="tests">
            <h2>4. Lab Tests & Early Results</h2>
            <p>
                Once we had printed samples, we examined them under microscopes, checking pore sizes and overall 
                integrity. Then we ran simple gas flow tests to see how well they adsorbed selected contaminants. 
                While these were just initial trials, we got encouraging signs that the 3D-printed zeolites kept 
                their adsorption properties and had potential for customization.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, we weren’t ready to ship them to ISS just yet—this was more about proving that 3D printing 
                could handle these materials and still yield functional filters.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="insights">
            <h2>5. What I Learned</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Material-Binder Balance:</strong> Too much binder made the paste too soft; too little, and it clogged the nozzle. Finding that sweet spot mattered.</li>
                <li><strong>Scale & Porosity:</strong> Printing and then sintering changed pore structure. Understanding that link was key to fine-tuning filter performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Adaptation for Space:</strong> This was a crash course in how design changes when resupply and gravity are limited. Everything has to be lighter, smarter, and more adaptable.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="future">
            <h2>6. Next Steps</h2>
            <p>
                With more time, we’d try different zeolite blends, explore other binders, and test with real ISS 
                contaminant mixtures. We could also look into methods for regenerating the filter material on orbit, 
                making the system more sustainable. This line of research could eventually help shape more advanced 
                environmental control systems for deep-space missions.

            <h2>7. Wrapping Up</h2>
            <p>
                Working on this project as a high school intern was a glimpse into how materials science, manufacturing, 
                and aerospace constraints intersect in a big way. Though my contribution was a small piece of a larger 
                puzzle, it was thrilling to be part of something that could one day help astronauts breathe a bit easier 
                in orbit. It taught me that even “simple” tasks—like making air filters—become high-stakes engineering 
                challenges when you’re in space.
