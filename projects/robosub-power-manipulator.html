            <strong>Team:</strong> Stanford Robosub 2024<br>
            <strong>My Role:</strong> Electrical and Systems Integration Lead for the Underwater Manipulator Arm<br>
            Within the Robosub project, I focused on integrating an underwater manipulator arm with our Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). 
            The primary aim was to achieve reliable actuation and tool manipulation capabilities under harsh marine conditions. 
            We combined mechanical, electrical, and software considerations to develop a compact, robust arm with a subsea-rated servo drive 
            and sensor fusion for precise positioning.

        <section id="overview">
            <h2>1. Overview & Competition Strategy</h2>
            <p>
                The Robosub 2024 competition challenged us to perform complex underwater tasks requiring precise manipulation, 
                such as interacting with markers, opening valves, and handling objects autonomously. Our strategy was to develop a 
                reliable, simple manipulator arm system integrated into the AUV’s broader localization and perception suite. 
                We aimed to avoid unnecessary complexity while ensuring that the arm could be used as a foundational platform 
                for future teams to expand upon.

        <section id="mechanical-design">
            <h2>2. Mechanical Design & Materials</h2>
            <p>
                The manipulator’s structure was informed by both space and robustness constraints. The arm features multiple 
                degrees of freedom (typically 4-6 DOF), using high-strength corrosion-resistant alloys (e.g., anodized aluminum 6061 T6, 
                stainless steel 316) and sealed bearings. We considered hydrodynamic effects, buoyancy, and load capacity to ensure 
                controlled movements in all orientations.

        <!-- Actuation & Control -->
        <section id="actuation">
            <h2>3. Actuation & Control</h2>
            <p>
                We integrated an underwater-rated servo system with sealed BLDC motors and harmonic drive gears for low backlash 
                and high torque density. The electrical architecture included proper power conditioning for the servo and custom 
                circuit boards to interface with the AUV's main computer. Software-level closed-loop control and current sensing 
                allowed stable operation despite external disturbances.
            </p>
            <p>
                To cope with the nonlinearities of underwater environments, PID-based joint controllers and advanced model-based 
                methods (feedforward compensation) were considered. While initial implementation relied on classical PD loops 
                with gain tuning, we planned eventual adoption of adaptive or robust controllers as we refined the arm’s hydrodynamic model.

        <!-- Kinematics & Motion Planning -->
        <section id="kinematics">
            <h2>4. Kinematics & Motion Planning</h2>
            <p>
                We developed inverse kinematics (IK) routines to allow task-level control (e.g., “move the gripper here”) rather than 
                joint-by-joint teleoperation. The manipulator’s DOF count allowed sufficient workspace coverage to reach targets 
                identified by the AUV’s vision system. Our control stack included:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Forward & Inverse Kinematics:</strong> Real-time computation to map between joint space and Cartesian space.</li>
                <li><strong>Trajectory Planning:</strong> Smooth path generation with minimal jerk, leveraging cubic or quintic splines.</li>
                <li><strong>Task-Level Priority:</strong> Prepared to add secondary objectives (e.g., avoid vehicle thrusters, maintain camera view).</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- AUV Integration & Challenges -->
        <section id="integration">
            <h2>5. Integration with the AUV</h2>
            <p>
                The arm’s design had to align with the AUV’s structural frame and internal electronics bay. We routed power and 
                data lines through pressure-compensated housings. The AUV’s limited payload capacity and volume constraints 
                forced careful trade-offs between arm length, torque capability, and operational depth rating. 
                Additionally, mounting location influenced sensor placement and hydrodynamic efficiency.
            </p>
            <p>
                Coordinated control between the manipulator and AUV motion was a key consideration. Maintaining stable hover 
                while operating the arm required integrating vehicle navigation, thruster control, and manipulator command signals. 
                We investigated feedforward terms based on manipulator kinematics to help the AUV’s controller anticipate shifts 
                in center of gravity and reduce unwanted vehicle motion.

        <!-- Testing & Iteration -->
        <section id="testing">
            <h2>6. Testing & Iteration</h2>
            <p>
                Our testing strategy included incremental pool trials, vacuum pressure tests for sealing, and in-lab simulations 
                using Gazebo ROS plugins for motion planning validation. We performed underwater calibration of joint encoders 
                and tested grip strength on standardized T-bar handles. Persistent challenges included:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Overheating:</strong> Addressed by adding small heatsinks and refining current profiles.</li>
                <li><strong>Waterproofing:</strong> Verified through vacuum pulls before submerging, ensuring stable internal pressure.</li>
                <li><strong>Communication Latency:</strong> Tested tethered and wireless acoustic links, focusing on stable real-time feedback.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>7. Key Outcomes & Learnings</h2>
            <p>
                Through this integration, I strengthened my understanding of system-level design for underwater robotics. Key learnings included:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Systems Engineering:</strong> Balancing mechanical constraints, hydrodynamic forces, and sensor integration is crucial.</li>
                <li><strong>Robust Control:</strong> Simple PID loops gave baseline performance, but future improvements include adaptive control and force feedback.</li>
                <li><strong>Kinematic Complexity:</strong> Using IK and trajectory planning improved task efficiency and operator workload.</li>
                <li><strong>Manufacturability & Maintenance:</strong> Ensuring easy access to the arm’s electronics and connectors accelerated iteration and reduced downtime.</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Conclusion -->
        <section id="conclusion">
            <h2>8. Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Integrating the manipulator arm into the Robosub AUV provided a foundation for future advanced intervention tasks. 
                Although we maintained a careful strategy focusing on reliability and simplicity, the groundwork was laid for more 
                complex autonomous manipulation scenarios. The insights gained here—ranging from control strategies in a fluid environment 
                to coordinated vehicle-arm maneuvers—will guide subsequent iterations and push toward more robust, fully autonomous 
                underwater robotic systems.
