        <h1>EE101B Lab 5: Class D Audio Amplifier</h1>
        <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Build and characterize a class-D amplifier using the TI TPA3122D2 IC and measure its performance.</p>
    </header>

        <h2>Setup & Assembly</h2>
        <p>
            The project started with a blank perfboard, a 20-pin DIP socket for the amplifier IC, and a collection of 
            specified components (resistors, ceramic and electrolytic capacitors, inductors). We attached standoffs for a stable 
            build platform and carefully soldered each component, checking polarity for electrolytics and ensuring no shorts 
            between VCC and GND before inserting the amplifier IC. 
        </p>
        <p>
            During the first week, we installed the core decoupling capacitors and essential biasing resistors to keep the 
            amplifier enabled and set to maximum gain. After verifying that all power rails were correct and the IC didn’t 
            heat excessively at idle (just VCC connected), we measured the quiescent current (about 20mA) and confirmed 
            a modulation frequency of around 250 kHz at the output with no input signal.

        <h2>Adding Input/Output Filters & Final Test</h2>
        <p>
            In the second week, we populated the input and output LC filters and DC-blocking capacitors. The inductors chosen 
            were 47μH (instead of 22μH) and the coupling caps were adjusted per the provided BOM differences. This filtering 
            stage was critical to remove unwanted high-frequency switching noise and to prevent DC offset from reaching the 
            load resistor or the speakers.

        <h2>Measurements & Observations</h2>
        <h3>THD and Frequency Response</h3>
        <p>
            With a 1kHz input sine wave at around 50mV and a 10Ω load, we measured the output waveform. The output amplitude 
            reached about 6.4V peak-to-peak, and we noted a THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) of about 0.041, which is quite 
            acceptable for a simple class-D setup. The LC and DC-blocking components effectively filtered the output, as shown 
            by a Bode-like magnitude plot from 10Hz to 50kHz. At low frequencies (10Hz), we saw reduced amplitude, as expected 
            (about 420mV p-p), while at 1kHz and above, the signal amplitude increased to around 6.3–6.5V p-p. High-frequency 
            roll-off was observed, confirming the filter’s role in removing unwanted switching harmonics.
        </p>

        <h3>Efficiency</h3>
        <p>
            We measured supply current and load power to estimate efficiency. Starting at about 50mV input, we got around 64.22%. 
            Increasing input voltage to 60mV, then 70mV, bumped efficiency to ~67.93% and ~68.57%, respectively. Higher output 
            levels made the circuit more efficient.

    <section id="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            The class-D amplifier performed as intended. After careful assembly and verification, we achieved a stable output, 
            relatively low THD, and a decent efficiency that improved with higher output levels. The LC and DC-blocking network 
            effectively shaped the frequency response, ensuring a cleaner audio signal. While the lab was challenging—requiring 
            meticulous soldering and debugging—the end result was a working class-D amplifier capable of driving a speaker load 
            with reasonable fidelity and efficiency.

        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Always double-check component orientations and pin connections before powering the circuit. 
        Improper polarity on electrolytics or reversed connections can damage components.</p>
