        <h1>EE101B Lab 5: Class D Audio Amplifier</h1>
        <p>
            This report describes building and characterizing a class-D audio amplifier. From selecting components 
            to refining our soldering techniques, the project merged theoretical circuit concepts with hands-on 
            fabrication, ultimately producing a functional, efficient amplifier tested with real-world signals.

            <h2>1. Introduction & Objectives</h2>
            <p>
                Class-D amplifiers offer high efficiency by using switching transistors and LC filters to reconstruct 
                audio signals. Our goal: implement a TI TPA3122D2-based amplifier from scratch, verifying that the 
                output waveform matches expectations and that distortion remains low.
            </p>
            <p>
                The objective was to learn how switching topologies differ from linear amps, and how component choices 
                and layout affect sound quality and efficiency.
            </p>

        <section id="circuit-design">
            <h2>2. Circuit Design & Component Selection</h2>
            <p>
                We followed a reference design, incorporating decoupling capacitors, LC output filters, and biasing 
                resistors to set the gain. Electrolytic capacitors handled power supply filtering; ceramic capacitors 
                ensured stable high-frequency operation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our chosen inductors were slightly higher than the reference (47μH vs. 22μH), which still provided 
                adequate filtering. Potentiometers were replaced with fixed resistors for maximum gain settings. 
                All design decisions aimed at stable, low-distortion audio output.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="assembly">
            <h2>3. Assembly & Soldering Process</h2>
            <p>
                Following best soldering practices, we placed components close to the IC, ensuring short paths for 
                critical signals. We tack-soldered first, checked VCC and GND continuity, then proceeded with final 
                solder beads. Careful attention to polarity on electrolytics was critical—reversing them can cause 
                failures or explosions.
            </p>
            <p>
                After assembly, we inspected joints for cold solder and tidied up connections. A stable mechanical 
                build meant less noise pickup and more consistent results.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="measurements">
            <h2>4. Measurements & Performance</h2>
            <p>
                With VCC at 12V, idle current around 20 mA confirmed low quiescent power consumption. Under signal input, 
                the amplifier reproduced 1 kHz tones with a peak-to-peak voltage ~6.4V at the load. We measured harmonic 
                components and found THD around 0.041, indicating decent audio fidelity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sweeping input frequencies (10 Hz to 50 kHz) showed the LC filters effectively removing unwanted 
                high-frequency components, ensuring the output resembled a clean analog waveform from a switching system.
            </p>

        <section id="lessons">
            <h2>5. Key Lessons Learned</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Soldering & Layout Matters:</strong> Physical layout heavily influences noise and stability.</li>
                <li><strong>Power & Efficiency:</strong> Higher voltages increased efficiency, demonstrating why class-D amps are preferred in portable applications.</li>
                <li><strong>Testing Strategy:</strong> Systematic measurements (THD, frequency response) provided clear benchmarks for improvement.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="future">
            <h2>6. Future Refinements</h2>
            <p>
                Potential improvements include implementing a closed-loop feedback path for even lower distortion, 
                adding better shielding against EMI, or testing different inductor values for optimal filter response. 
                We could also integrate a Bluetooth module for wireless audio input.
            </p>

        <section id="conclusion">
            <h2>7. Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Building and testing the class-D amplifier deepened my understanding of switching power circuits, 
                practical layout constraints, and the importance of careful component selection. The final amplifier 
                worked reliably, offering a hands-on demonstration of how class-D principles translate into real, 
                efficient audio systems.
