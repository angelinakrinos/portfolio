        <h1>Stelaris Solar-Powered PCB: Renewable Energy, Simplified</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>Course:</strong> EE 156: Board-Level Design<br>
            <strong>Date:</strong> November 5, 2024<br>
            Stelaris is a solar charging PCB concept I developed to efficiently power phones and small devices using sunlight. 
            By combining an ESP32-S3 microcontroller, INA219 sensors, an ST7735 LCD, and an SD card for data logging, 
            I created a board-level system that highlights how engineering choices—like careful component selection, 
            power regulation, and robust firmware—can make solar energy more practical in everyday electronics.

        <!-- Overview Section -->
        <section id="overview">
            <h2>1. Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Stelaris began as a class project focused on turning solar energy into a stable charging solution for small devices.
                The design integrates:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>ESP32-S3 Microcontroller:</strong> Dual-core processor with low power usage.</li>
                <li><strong>INA219 Sensors:</strong> Accurate current and voltage measurements over I2C.</li>
                <li><strong>ST7735 LCD:</strong> A compact, colorful SPI-driven display for real-time status updates.</li>
                <li><strong>SD Card Module:</strong> On-board data logging to track long-term performance.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Designing with Solar Panels -->
        <section id="solar-design">
            <h2>2. Designing with Solar Panels</h2>
            <h3>2.1 Solar Panel Selection</h3>
            <p>
                Choosing the right solar panel was all about balance. I went with 12V panels to ensure enough headroom, 
                even under cloudy conditions. This choice gave me reliable power output and simplified downstream regulation.
            </p>
            <h3>2.2 Voltage Regulation</h3>
            <p>
                To protect the battery and keep everything running smoothly, I used the RTQ2520GQW LDO regulator to 
                cleanly step down the voltage. This ensured stable operation for all sensitive components.
            </p>

        <!-- Schematic & BOM -->
        <section id="schematic">
            <h2>3. Schematic Design</h2>
            <p>
                The schematic mapped out every connection—from the ESP32-S3 host MCU and INA219 sensors to the LCD and SD card. 
                Careful attention went into power rails, voltage dividers, and communication lines to ensure stable and reliable performance.

            <h2>4. Bill of Materials (BOM)</h2>
            <p>
                Each component was selected for performance, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Key parts included:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>ESP32-S3:</strong> Power-efficient MCU with built-in Wi-Fi and BLE.</li>

        <!-- PCB Layout -->
        <section id="pcb-layout">
            <h2>5. PCB Layout</h2>
            <p>
                The PCB went through several design tweaks. Early layouts revealed issues with SD card signal integrity 
                and minor calibration problems in the voltage sensing circuits. Iterations focused on cleaner routing, 
                improved component placement, and better spacing for test points.

        <!-- Assembly Process -->
        <section id="assembly">
            <h2>6. Assembly</h2>
            <p>
                Assembly started with hand soldering to validate early prototypes. As the design matured, I moved to a reflow oven 
                for consistent solder joints. Though I considered a pick-and-place machine, the final volume and complexity 
                made reflow the more practical choice.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Firmware Development -->
        <section id="firmware">
            <h2>7. Firmware</h2>
            <p>
                The firmware handled everything from sensor polling to updating the LCD in real-time. INA219 readings were pulled via I2C, 
                while the ST7735 display interface used SPI for quick screen refreshes. Data was continuously logged to the SD card 
                for later review.
            </p>

            <pre><code class="language-rust">
// Example INA219 Initialization in Rust
let config = I2cConfig::new().baudrate(400.kHz().into());
let i2c = I2cDriver::new(peripherals.i2c1, peripherals.pins.gpio8, peripherals.pins.gpio9, &config)?;
let mut sensor1 = INA219::new(i2c, 0x40);

// LCD Setup
let mut display = ST7735::new(spi, dc_pin, rst_pin, false, false, 130, 131);
display.init(&mut delay)?;
display.set_orientation(&Orientation::PortraitSwapped)?;
</code></pre>
        </section>

        <!-- Programming the PCB -->
        <section id="programming">
            <h2>8. Programming</h2>
            <p>
                Programming was straightforward with the Rust toolchain and ESP-IDF. Flashing and debugging the firmware 
                used cargo-espflash, making iteration and testing quick and efficient.
            </p>

            <pre><code>
// Flash firmware
cargo espflash --release /dev/ttyUSB0

// Monitor output
cargo espflash monitor
</code></pre>

        <!-- Design Evolution & Challenges -->
        <section id="evolution">
            <h2>9. Design Evolution</h2>
            <h3>9.1 Challenges and Solutions</h3>
            <p>
                Early challenges included unreliable SD card reads and imprecise voltage monitoring. By refining the SPI routing 
                and recalibrating voltage dividers, I achieved more stable, accurate operation. Each iteration offered a lesson 
                in PCB design fundamentals and practical debugging.
            </p>

        <!-- Conclusion -->
        <section id="conclusion">
            <h2>10. Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Stelaris went from a concept to a working prototype that demonstrates how solar power can be integrated into 
                practical PCB designs. I honed my skills in everything from initial component selection to firmware optimization. 
                This project taught me that a good design isn’t just about making something work—it’s about refining it 
                until it’s reliable, efficient, and ready for real-world challenges.
